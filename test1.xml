<content>This is a bunch of text, I want you to be sure that you understand exactly what this text is trying to say
This text should have multiple doctrines such as faith, prayer, repentance the the gift of the Holy Ghost. 
This file will also have multiple scriptures in here such as Alma 32:4-5 and Mosiah chapter 6. The scriptures
are in large mesure different for each line Alma 45:34 and Alma 32:6. I also really like Ether chapter 23:7.</content>

<content>I love this church, it is incredible to be able to feel the spirit so strongly every
time that I choose to keep the commandments. I want to live forever with my Heavenly
Father because he wants me to be happy. One place that I saw Heavenly Fathers
hand today was in 2 Nephi 5 where they taught what it means to have the gospel in
ones life. We must love Jesus Christ if we want to be happy. I love this gospel!</content>

I want to add a new entry to make sure that this file is working. The gospel of Jesus Christ is good, and it help people to gain faith in the atonement. One of the important things that will happen in this life according to Mosiah 2 is that we will be able to serve our fellow man. Alma 5 gives us several very imporatant question regarding our rightiousness and blessings. If we chose to follow the example of Jesus Christ we will be much better off. </content>
